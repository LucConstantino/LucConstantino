# üí´ About Me:
Hello! My name is Lucas, and I'm a Flutter developer.<br><br>I started programming around 2020, initially focusing on Android development with Java and Kotlin. In 2022, I made the decision to fully transition to Flutter, as I felt it was a perfect fit for me, and I've been developing my skills in it ever since.<br><br>I have previously worked with Next Bank and the BoxOffice application. Currently, I am involved in the development of another digital bank, which will be a multi-platform solution.<br><br>I am also learning Back-End development using GoLang.
